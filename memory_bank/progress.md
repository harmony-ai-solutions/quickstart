# Project Harmony.AI Quickstart - Progress

## Current Status Overview
The Quickstart project is a stable and functional deployment solution for the Harmony.AI ecosystem. It provides pre-configured Docker Compose setups for both CPU-only and NVIDIA GPU environments, enabling rapid deployment of Harmony Link, Harmony Speech Engine, and Text-Generation WebUI.

## What Works (Completed Features)

### âœ… Core Deployment
- **Docker Compose Setup**: Functional `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.nvidia.yml` for multi-service orchestration.
- **Containerized Services**: All core Harmony.AI components (Harmony Link, Speech Engine, Text-Generation WebUI, Speech UI) are successfully containerized.
- **Image Management**: Utilizes `pull_policy: always` to ensure up-to-date Docker images from Docker Hub.
- **Port Mapping**: Correctly maps container ports to host ports for external access.

### âœ… Configuration Management
- **Volume Mounts**: Persistent storage for configurations (`config.json`, `config.yml`), models, and cache directories.
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file support for flexible configuration (e.g., `APP_RUNTIME_UID`, `HOST_PORT`).
- **Internal Networking**: Services communicate seamlessly within the Docker network using service names.

### âœ… Resource Optimization
- **CPU-Only Profile**: Default setup for broad compatibility.
- **NVIDIA GPU Profile**: Dedicated Docker Compose file for leveraging NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated inference.

### âœ… Documentation
- **Comprehensive README.md**: Provides clear instructions for getting started, system requirements, and configuration details.

## What's Currently Being Built (N/A - This is a deployment project)
The Quickstart project itself is primarily a deployment and integration solution. Its "progress" is measured by the stability, ease of use, and completeness of its integrated components. New features would typically be added to the individual Harmony.AI projects (Harmony Link, Speech Engine, etc.) and then integrated into the Quickstart.

## What's Left to Build (Potential Enhancements)

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: User Experience & Accessibility
- **Automated Setup Script**: A script to guide users through Docker installation and initial repository cloning/setup.
- **Interactive Configuration**: A simple CLI or web-based tool to help users customize `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., enable/disable services, set ports).
- **Pre-downloaded Models**: Option to include smaller, default models within the repository or provide a script to download them.

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Advanced Deployment Options
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Provide K8s configurations for production-grade, scalable deployments.
- **Cloud Deployment Templates**: Offer templates for deploying on AWS, Azure, GCP.
- **ARM/Apple Silicon Support**: Docker images and configurations optimized for ARM-based architectures.

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Monitoring & Management
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Add Prometheus/Grafana setup for real-time performance monitoring of services.
- **Centralized Logging**: Implement a logging stack (e.g., ELK stack) for aggregated logs.
- **Health Checks**: Enhance Docker Compose health checks for more robust service management.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Issues
- **Harmony Link UI Access**: Dockerized Harmony Link UI is not directly exposed via Web URL; requires manual `config.json` adjustment for internal Docker network routes.
- **Model Download**: Users must manually download AI models for Text-Generation WebUI.
- **Initial Setup**: Requires manual Docker installation and Git cloning.

### Technical Debt (N/A - Minimal for a deployment project)
- The project's technical debt would primarily stem from the individual components it integrates.

### Future Considerations
- **Offline Mode**: Ability to run without internet access after initial setup.
- **Security Hardening**: Best practices for production deployments (e.g., non-root users, network policies).
- **Version Management**: More explicit versioning of Docker images for stability.

## Recent Achievements (This Session)
- **Initial Documentation**: Comprehensive README.md created.
- **Docker Compose Files**: CPU and NVIDIA GPU configurations established.
- **Component Integration**: Successful orchestration of Harmony Link, Speech Engine, and Text-Generation WebUI.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Docker-first Approach**: Chosen for portability, isolation, and ease of deployment.
- **Separate CPU/GPU Compose Files**: Provides clear options for different hardware setups.
- **Volume-based Configuration**: Allows users to easily modify settings without rebuilding images.

## Success Metrics
- **Deployment Success Rate**: High percentage of users successfully launching the stack.
- **Time to First Interaction**: Minimal time from download to a working AI character.
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of CPU/GPU resources.
- **User Feedback**: Positive feedback on ease of setup and functionality.
