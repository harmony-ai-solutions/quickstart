# Project Harmony.AI Quickstart - Project Brief

## Project Overview
The Project Harmony.AI Quickstart repository provides scripts and configurations for rapidly setting up and running the core Harmony.AI modules locally using Docker. It offers a simplified, containerized approach to deploy Harmony Link, Harmony Speech Engine, and a specialized Text-Generation WebUI.

## Core Purpose
- To provide a "one-click" setup for the Harmony.AI ecosystem.
- To simplify the deployment and configuration of interconnected AI services.
- To enable quick experimentation and development with Harmony.AI technologies.

## High-Level Goals
1. **Ease of Use**: Minimize setup complexity for new users.
2. **Comprehensive Environment**: Deploy all essential Harmony.AI components.
3. **Resource Flexibility**: Support both CPU-only and GPU (NVIDIA) environments.
4. **Consistent Experience**: Ensure reliable and reproducible deployments.
5. **Accelerated Development**: Provide a ready-to-use platform for building on Harmony.AI.

## Key Innovation
The Quickstart project's innovation lies in its ability to abstract away the complexities of individual service installations and inter-service communication, providing a fully integrated and functional AI character interaction environment with minimal user effort.

## Target Users
- New users and developers evaluating Harmony.AI.
- Content creators and researchers needing a quick setup for AI characters.
- Developers building plugins or integrations with Harmony.AI.
- Anyone seeking a self-contained, local AI character ecosystem.

## Core Requirements
- Docker Desktop or Docker installation.
- Sufficient system resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) as per component requirements.
- Basic understanding of Docker compose for launching/stopping services.
