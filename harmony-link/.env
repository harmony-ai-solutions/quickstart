# Some Harmony Link Plugins need to have a local file reference on the Disk of the host machine
# for processing data like TTS audio which was generated by a backend service.
# Harmony Link will store these files inside the harmony-tmp dir until they have been processed
# Inside the container however, the path is a different one, so for the plugin to find it, comment
# in this line
