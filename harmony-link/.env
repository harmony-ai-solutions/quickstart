# Some Harmony Link Plugins need to have a local file reference on the Disk of the host machine
# for processing data like TTS audio which was generated by a backend service.
# Harmony Link will store these files inside the harmony-tmp dir until they have been processed
# Inside the container however, the path is a different one, so for the plugin to find it, comment
# in this line and make sure the path points to the harmony-tmp dir on the host, in HOST path patterns.
# See below examples
HARMONY_TMP_HOST_DIR="D:\projects\quickstart\harmony-link\harmony-tmp" # Windows
# HARMONY_TMP_HOST_DIR="/home/user/harmony/quickstart" # Linux / MacOS

# This is the path where the quickstart repo is mounted inside the container.
# To avoid discrepancy between host and container level, make sure this path is equal to the path on the host machine
# and mount it exactly identically inside the docker-compose file
# e.g. /home/user/harmony/quickstart:/home/user/harmony/quickstart
#
# If you're running WSL, make sure this path consists of "/run/desktop/mnt/host/" and
# the actual path on the host with linux type path pattern (slash instead of backslash), e.g.
# "/run/desktop/mnt/host/" + "d/projects/quickstart"
# as shown in the example below.
QUICKSTART_REPO_MOUNT_PATH="/run/desktop/mnt/host/d/projects/quickstart" # Windows + WSL
# QUICKSTART_REPO_MOUNT_PATH="/home/user/harmony/quickstart" # Linux / MacOS
