# Harmony Link Container Setup

This README provides setup specifics for the Harmony Link container.

## Environment Variables via .env file

The `.env` file contains environment variables required to be set when using some Harmony Link plugins.

- `HARMONY_TMP_HOST_DIR`: Specifies a host directory for temporary files used by plugins, such as TTS audio generated by a backend service. 
Uncomment and set this variable in the `.env` file if needed.
It is crucial that this directory is provided as an absolute path on the host machine via this env var, 
as well as a volume mount in the container definition inside the docker compose file being used,
so both Harmony Link inside the container as well as the plugin can access it.

## Docker Compose Mounts

The mounts defined in the `docker-compose.yml` use the files and folders in this `harmony-link` subfolder to make them accessible to the container.
For example:
```
volumes:
  - ./harmony-link/config.json:/app/config.json
  - ./harmony-link/harmony-user.key:/app/harmony-user.key
  - ./harmony-link/harmony-tmp:/app/harmony-tmp
```
Please ensure that those configuration files and directories are available at the specified paths and docker and the plugin process have write permission on them.
