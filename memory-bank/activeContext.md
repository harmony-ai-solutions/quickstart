# Project Harmony.AI Quickstart - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The Quickstart project is currently stable and serves its purpose as a deployment solution. The focus is on ensuring its continued compatibility with Harmony Link's evolving integration management features.

## Recent Changes
- **Structure Refinement**: Introduced `.automation/` and `templates/` directories for better organization of Docker Compose configurations.
- **Integrations Manifest (`integrations.json`)**: Created to enable Harmony Link to discover and manage services within this repository.
- **Docker Compose Centralization**: Simplified the root `docker-compose.yml` to primarily orchestrate Harmony Link itself, with other services now managed via Harmony Link's UI.
- **Harmony Link as Orchestrator**: Configured Harmony Link to act as a privileged Docker client, capable of managing other containers in this repository, even when Harmony Link itself is containerized.
- **Template Path Resolution**: Adjusted `env_file` and `volumes` paths in integration templates for correct resolution when deployed by Harmony Link.
- **Docker Compose Labels**: Added labels to integration services for accurate container discovery by Harmony Link.
- **Git Repository Management**: Updated `.gitignore` to prevent conflicts with nested Git repositories.

## Next Steps
- **Monitor Compatibility**: Continuously ensure compatibility with new Harmony Link features and updates.
- **Explore Enhancements**: Investigate potential enhancements such as automated setup scripts or interactive configuration tools, as outlined in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Maintaining the Quickstart project as a user-friendly and reliable deployment solution for the Harmony.AI ecosystem.
- Ensuring that the integration with Harmony Link remains seamless and robust.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The shift to Harmony Link as the central orchestration hub has significantly improved the user experience for deploying and managing the Harmony.AI ecosystem.
- The modularization of Docker Compose configurations into `templates/` and `.automation/` enhances maintainability and flexibility.
